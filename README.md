# Change-of-Dice
My Solo Entry to GMTK 2022,
using python and pygame

A Puzzle Game with the core mechanic

I created the code and sprites for this project.

Credit for the music can be found on the game's itch page, alongside builds for windows.
Also note that the source on github has an extra "level" at the start, press "Q" to skip that
